      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Separate the Note model implementation from the SwiftData container setup",
      "reasoning": "While the model itself is simple, integrating SwiftData adds some complexity and requires careful implementation"

      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the NoteListView implementation into UI layout, data fetching, navigation setup, and empty state handling",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple SwiftUI concepts and integration with SwiftData, requiring careful structuring"

      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the NoteDetailView implementation into UI components, data binding, auto-focus logic, and navigation integration",
      "reasoning": "This task requires handling both new and existing notes, managing focus state, and integrating with SwiftData, increasing its complexity"

      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Separate color scheme implementation from testing and verification tasks",
      "reasoning": "While conceptually simple, this task requires thorough testing and potentially subtle adjustments across the app"
